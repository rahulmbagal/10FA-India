Habit Tracker,"¬ª <b>Organize Your Life!</b>
HabitBull is the most powerful multi-platform companion to keep track of your day to day habits and routines<p></p>
¬ª <b>Fully Customisable</b>
Measure and track anything and everything. Follow your own schedule and track your own goals. Get notified whenever you need to do something important.<p></p>
¬ª <b>Cut Bad Habits From Your Life</b>
Simply start tracking bad habits like nail biting, smoking or drinking too much. Once you see the patterns, it's easier to break them. HabitBull keeps you accountable. Also great for users of NoFap!<p></p>
¬ª <b>Add Some Positive Habits</b>
Want to go for a nice walk every day? Or maybe give 3 hugs every Saturday and Sunday? Join us on this journey!<p></p>
¬ª <b>Who is it for?</b>
Whether you want to read some more, stop smoking, start working out or even just track how many hours you wasted on Facebook, this app lets you do it!<p></p>
¬ª <b>Features</b>
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Track multiple habits, repeated to do's or goals, each in its own calendar
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Streak counter and percentage successful for each habit
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Yes/No or Number goals
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Very flexible goals like: number of times per day/week/month, only on certain days of the week etc. For example: 30 push ups every Mon-Fri, go to the gym 2 times per week, or even every 2 days
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Inspiring quotes per category - including actual quotes from people doing it (meditation, reading, stop drinking alcohol, stop smoking cigarettes, stop procrastination etc)
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Graphs with success percentage / streak, entered values etc
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Powerful reminders - multiple times per day, repeating within a time period, sound and vibrate optional
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Home screen / lock screen widget
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Multi-device syncing
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Cloud backup
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Motivational images
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Export to CSV
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Dark theme
‚Ä¢‚ÄÉ Google Fit integration<p></p>
¬ª <b>How it works:</b>
1. Set up a habit
2. Tell HabitBull how you went for a day
3. Watch your daily streak increase<p></p>
Habits are no more than routines which you perform subconsciously. To build one - train yourself. To break one, find another one which is similar, yet different and nicer, and repeat it until it sticks.<p></p>
To assist you with this HabitBull lets you set reminders for each habit and displays them on days when you need to be successful. This is especially useful if you have a to do list with repeating tasks or if you want to be reminded to do the same thing every day. It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).<p></p>
HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don't give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.<p></p>
There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills.
It is entirely up to you, really. But why not give it a try and have a convenient helper on the go?<p></p>","¬ª <b>Organize Your Life!</b><br>HabitBull is the most powerful multi-platform companion to keep track of your day to day habits and routines<p></p><br>¬ª <b>Fully Customisable</b><br>Measure and track anything and everything.

It can also be used as a calendar planning tool or checklist, but also as a very effective repeating reminder (e.g. to drink water every 2 hours).<p></p><br>HabitBull does feel a little like a game in which you compete with yourself. The task is to get a long streak for the habit you are working on by covering your goals. The longer the better. It takes a couple of months to fully build a new routine, so don&#39;t give up - it takes time and if you are consistent it will work; even if it takes a few attempts.<p></p><br>There are many things which you may want to improve. HabitBull can be used as a planner in building habits like taking your pills regularly, exercise, or keep to a diet. It can also be used as a helper for people suffering from memory problems. As for your vices, HabitBull can be a useful goal tracking tool, or a smart notebook, to assist you while breaking bad habits like nail-biting, drinking alcohol and even improving your dating skills.<br>It is entirely up to you, really. But why not give it a try and have a convenient helper on the go?<p></p>","Organize Your life, Track Daily Goals, Build Powerful Habits!

‚úî Schedule the day. Your daily routine is now more comfortable than ever. Follow it and improve, just use the application as an organizer of cases and diary tasks.
‚úî Timer trips and the duration of air travel. Because of the endless trips and flights, you lose track of time? Control the time of registration, landing and the duration of the flight. Keep everything under control.

‚úî Your Timesheet. You can easily visualize time, and your timesheet will become very visual. Line up your schedule of cases in a visual form.

"TimeTune - Optimize Your Time, Productivity & Life","<b>Doing more things with your time. Increasing your productivity. Improving your daily routine.</b>

This is what you can achieve with TimeTune, your routine planner.

Have you ever wondered why some people can get plenty of things done in a single day while your time slips through your fingers?

The answer is that they have a very sound and organized distribution of time. They use healthy routines and stick to them, allowing them to squeeze every available minute, create good habits and do everything in their schedule.

With TimeTune you can do the same.

<b>Here are some features to help you achieve it:</b>

‚òÖ Time management based on routines and suitable for everyone who values their time (workers, students, parents, freelancers...)
‚òÖ Routines can be weekly, daily or have an odd number of days (for professions with unusual shifts), adding great flexibility to your schedule
‚òÖ Routines work like a calendar but you don't need to enter calendar dates, they repeat automatically
‚òÖ You can create attractive custom tags to quickly identify the activities in your schedule at a glance
‚òÖ Full customization for each notification independently (vibration, sound, personal message, popup window and even voice)
‚òÖ Routine statistics to analyze your distribution of time, so you can detect time leaks, increase your productivity and do everything in your schedule
‚òÖ Besides routines, you can create events to schedule activities that don't fit in a routine: one-time activities, activities without duration or tasks with an odd repetition cycle
‚òÖ Widget with a completely customizable look so you can examine your schedule the way you like

<b>You can use TimeTune:</b>

‚òÖ For timeboxing / time blocking
‚òÖ As your routine manager
‚òÖ As your task reminder
‚òÖ As your student calendar
‚òÖ As your timetable planner
‚òÖ As your habit creation tool
‚òÖ As your productivity enhancer... and more!
